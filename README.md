# cis-aws-foundations-baseline

InSpec profile to validate your VPC to the standards of the CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.1.0 - 11-29-2016

## Description

This [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) compliance profile implement the [CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](https://github.com/mitre/cis-aws-foundations-baseline) in an automated way to provide security best-practice tests in an AWS environment.

InSpec is an open-source run-time framework and rule language used to specify compliance, security, and policy requirements for testing any node in your infrastructure.

## Versioning and State of Development

This project uses the [Semantic Versioning Policy](https://semver.org/).

### Branches

The master branch contains the latest version of the software leading up to a new release.

Other branches contain feature-specific updates.

### Tags

Tags indicate official releases of the project.

Please note 0.x releases are works in progress (WIP) and may change at any time.

## Requirements

- [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) at least version 2.1
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) at least version 2.x

### Tested Platforms

This profile is being developed and tested along side a `hardening` recipe implemented in Terraform. The [cis-aws-foundations-hardening](https://github.com/mitre/cis-aws-foundations-hardening) will help you configure and deploy your AWS environment to meet the requirements of the security baseline.

## Get started

Bundle install required gems <br>
- `bundle install`

Before running the profile with InSpec, define environment variables with your AWS region and credentials.  InSpec supports the following standard AWS variables:

- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) - required if MFA is enabled

### Notes on MFA

In an AWS MFA enabled enviroment - you need to use derived credentials to use the CLI. Your default AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY will not satisfy the MFA Policies in the AWS environment for full use of the AWS api.

- The AWS documentation is here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html
- The AWS profile documentation is here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html
- A useful bash script for automating this is here: https://gist.github.com/dinvlad/d1bc0a45419abc277eb86f2d1ce70625

*Prior* to running the InSpec Profile, you will need to generate credentials:

1. aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<$YOUR-MFA-SERIAL> --token-code <$YOUR-CURRENT-MFA-TOKEN> --profile=<$YOUR-AWS-PROFILE>

2. Then export the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN that was generated by the above command.

## Attributes

We use a yml attribute file to steer the configuration, the following options are available:
The followiing attributes must be set to accepted/documented values which is
then verified by the applicable controls.

These attributes are generated if the profile is used with the Terraform hardening receipe (https://github.com/mitre/cis-aws-foundations-hardening) with kitchen-terraform.

- default aws key age (1.4), <br>
`aws_key_age: 90`

- Make the password length (1.9), <br>
`pwd_length: 14`

- make the aws_cred_age an attribute (1.11), <br>
`aws_cred_age: 90`

```


## Generate Attributes

The repo includes a script : generate_attributes.rb to generate part of the attributes required for the profile.
The script will inspect aws regions: us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2 to generate the following attributes to STDOUT.

```
- config_delivery_channels
- sns_topics
- sns_subscriptions
```
The generated attributes __must be reviewed carefully__ and can be placed in the atttributes yaml file required for the inspec run.

Usage:
```
  ruby generate_attributes.rb
```
## Usage

InSpec makes it easy to run your tests wherever you need. More options listed here: [InSpec cli](http://inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/)

```
# Clone Inspec Profile
$ git clone https://github.com/aaronlippold/cis-aws-foundations-baseline

# Install Gems
$ bundle install

# Set required ENV variables
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key-id
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=access-key

# Provide required data in attributes.yml
# Following script can be used to auto-generate part of the attributes.yml
$ ruby generate_attributes.rb

# run profile locally and directly from Github
$ inspec exec /path/to/profile -t aws:// --attrs=attributes.yml

# run profile locally and directly from Github with cli & json output
$ inspec exec /path/to/profile -t aws:// --attrs=attributes.yml --reporter cli json:aws-results.json

```

### Run individual controls

In order to verify individual controls, just provide the control ids to InSpec:

```
$ inspec exec /path/to/profile --attrs=attributes.yml --controls cis-aws-foundations-1.10
```
