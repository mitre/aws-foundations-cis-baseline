# aws-foundations-cis-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of Amazon Web Services against [CIS'](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark Version 1.2.0 - 05-23-2018

## Getting Started
It is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile be run from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __AWS CLI__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

The latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

This baseline also requires the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) which is available at the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) site (at least version 2.x).

### Minimum Permissions needed to Run this Profile

The IAM account used to run this profile against the AWS environment needs to attached through a group or role with at least `AWS IAM "ReadOnlyAccess" Managed Policy` 

### Getting MFA Aware AWS Access, Secret and Session Tokens

You will need to ensure your AWS CLI environment has the right system environment variables set with your AWS region and credentials and session token to use the AWS CLI and InSpec resources in the AWS environment. InSpec supports the following standard AWS variables:

- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) - required if MFA is enabled

### Notes on MFA

In any AWS MFA enabled environment - you need to use `derived credentials` to use the CLI. Your default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` will not satisfy the MFA Policies in AWS environments. 

- The AWS documentation is here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html
- The AWS profile documentation is here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html
- A useful bash script for automating this is here: https://gist.github.com/dinvlad/d1bc0a45419abc277eb86f2d1ce70625

To generate credentials using an AWS Profile you will need to use the following AWS CLI commands.

  a. `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<$YOUR-MFA-SERIAL> --token-code <$YOUR-CURRENT-MFA-TOKEN> --profile=<$YOUR-AWS-PROFILE>` 

  b. Then export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` that was generated by the above command.

## Tailoring to Your Environment
The following inputs must be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```
- Primary aws region (2.5)
default_aws_region: 'us-east-1'

- List of **documented service accounts** which are exempt from the MFA requirement (1.2)
service_account_mfa_exceptions:
  - user1
  - user2
  - ...

- List of buckets exempted from inspection (2.3, 2.6)
exception_bucket_list: ["exception_bucket_name"]

- List of security groups exempted from inspection (4.1, 4.2)
exception_security_group_list: ["exception_security_group_name"]

- Config service list and settings in all relevant regions (2.5)
config_delivery_channels:
  us-east-1:
    s3_bucket_name: "s3_bucket_name_value"
    sns_topic_arn: "sns_topic_arn_value"
  us-east-2:
    s3_bucket_name: "s3_bucket_name_value"
    sns_topic_arn: "sns_topic_arn_value"
  us-west-1:
    s3_bucket_name: "s3_bucket_name_value"
    sns_topic_arn: "sns_topic_arn_value"
  us-west-2:
    s3_bucket_name: "s3_bucket_name_value"
    sns_topic_arn: "sns_topic_arn_value"

```

## Generate Inputs

The repo includes a script : generate_inputs.rb to generate part of the inputs required for the profile.
The script will inspect aws regions: us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2 to generate the following input to STDOUT.

```
- config_delivery_channels
```

## Usage

```
# Set required ENV variables
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key-id
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=access-key
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=session_token
$ export AWS_REGION=us-west-1

# Run the `generate_inputs.rb` 
$ ruby generate_inputs.rb
# The generated inputs __must be reviewed carefully__. 
# Only __valid__ channels should be placed in the inputs.yml file.
```

# Running This Baseline Directly from Github

```
# How to run
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-foundations-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

### Different Run Options

  [Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)

## Running This Baseline from a local Archive copy 

If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this baseline and all of its dependent tests:

(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)

When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile baseline for the first time, follow these steps: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/aws-foundations-cis-baseline
inspec archive aws-foundations-cis-baseline
inspec exec <name of generated archive> --target aws:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```
For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this baseline:

```
cd aws-foundations-cis-baseline
git pull
cd ..
inspec archive aws-foundations-cis-baseline --overwrite
inspec exec <name of generated archive> --target aws:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

## Using Heimdall for Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
